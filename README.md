Reflection objects are used for obtaining type information at runtime. 
Reflection has the following applications:
    It allows view attribute information at runtime.
    It allows examining various types in an assembly and instantiate these types.
    It allows late binding to methods and properties
    It allows creating new types at runtime and then performs some tasks using those types.
